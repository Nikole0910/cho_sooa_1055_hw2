## Credits

An issue I had: I had an issue in my CSS that I repeatedly redefined a class.
I should defined separate classes for each puzzle board section (e.g., .puzzle-board-0, .puzzle-board-1, .puzzle-board-2, and .puzzle-board-3) and assigned these classes to the corresponding HTML elements to fix the said issue.
